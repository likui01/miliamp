# MILAMP: Multiple Instance Prediction of Amyloid Proteins 
This is the Python implementation of MILAMP a Amyloid predicting algorithm.
Papar "MILAMP: Multiple Instance Prediction of Amyloid Proteins", accepted in [2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31443048/).

## The Amyloid prediction server

Online sever is avaliable at http://milamp.pythonanywhere.com/ to test proteins.  

## Testing 

```
python main.py
```
The trained classifier are uploaded, following tasks can be accomplished 

- Amyloid Prediction
- Identification of hotspot regions
- Detection in change in aggregation propensities of amnio acids
